# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
# and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically 
# stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a 
# summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() 
# that prints a personalized greeting to the user.
# Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
# for each user.
