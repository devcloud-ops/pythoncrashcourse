# You can create almost any set of numbers you want to using the range()
# function. For example, consider how you might make a list of the first 10
# square numbers (that is, the square of each integer from 1 through 10). In
# Python, two asterisks (**) represent exponents. Hereâ€™s how you might put
# the first 10 square numbers into a list:

squares = []
for value in range(1,11):
    square = value ** 2
    squares.append(square)

print(squares)
