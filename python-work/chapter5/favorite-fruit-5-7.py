# 5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a 
# series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your 
# list.

# i) Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

# ii) Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of 
# fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should 
# print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

# senario i
favorite_fruits = ['banana', 'watermelon', 'mango']

# senario ii
if 'oranges' in favorite_fruits:
    print('\nYou really like Oranges!')
if ('mango' in favorite_fruits):
    print('\nYou really like Mangoes!')
if ('banana' in favorite_fruits):
    print('You really like Banana!')
if ('watermelon' in favorite_fruits):
    print('You really like Watermelons!')
if ('grape' in favorite_fruits):
    print('You really like Grapes!')
