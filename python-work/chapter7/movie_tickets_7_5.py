# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices 
# depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket
# is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are 
# over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their 
# age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.
