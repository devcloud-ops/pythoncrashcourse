# 6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a 
# different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the 
# ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop 
# through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.
