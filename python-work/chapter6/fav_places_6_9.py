# 6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of
# three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite
# places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask
# some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the
# dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
