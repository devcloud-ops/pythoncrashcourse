# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
# information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing 
# different albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are 
# storing the album information correctly.

# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to
# store the year that album was released. If the calling line includes a value 
# for the year of album release, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at 
# least one new function call that includes the year of release of that album.
