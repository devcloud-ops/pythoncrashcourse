# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a 
# dictionary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model 
# name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
# Call the function with the required information and two other name-value 
# pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for
# a call like this one: 
# ____________________________________________________________________
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True) 
# ____________________________________________________________________
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all 
# the information was stored correctly.
